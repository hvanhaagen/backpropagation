# backpropagation
These files belong to a tutorial series on backpropagation. You can find these on my medium blog. 
https://medium.com/@hermandetest/backpropagation-algorithm-part-1-f3ca23bcaef1

In this series I discuss the following topics:
-the derivative
-the partial derivative
-the chain rule
-gradient descent
-loss function
-epoch
-learning rate
-update rule
-backpropagation in a neural network

I try to write this blog for people with no background in math or engineering. It should be accessible for non technical people
